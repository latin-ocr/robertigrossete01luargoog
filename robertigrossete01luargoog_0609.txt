The following ERRATA in the Chroniole of BARTHOLOMEW

DE COTTON have been observed by myself οι· others
since its publication.

Page 104, 1. 30, read “ Landford, manno (palefrido).’' The chronicler is
copying from the same source as OxenedeS, and thinking ‘mamm obscure,
put palefrido in the margin to explain it, and ‚thence the scribe put it
into the text, and joined manno to Landford‚ as if one word.

Page 110, l. 25, “eorone or etone.” A friend has suggested to me that
this is a blundel· of the scribe for corone, Becket’s erown at Canterbury.

Page 145, 1. 28, sor ‘· congregavit. Et ” read ‘⁴ congregavit, ut.'’

Page 215. The sultan's letter to Hayton 11. has been printed from a dif-
ferent MS. at the end of Hearne's Adam de Domerham, pp. 727—9.

Page 355, 1. 23, sor “ wincestreschire ’⁹ read ‘⁴ Wircestresehire.”

Pago 371, 1. 3, fin· “ provincialis ” read “ Provinciali5.”

Page 447, col. 2,1. 10, read “ Stranlingum‚ 17 7. The fur of the squirrel.
See Riley’s Glossary to the Liber Gustumarum‚ p. 829.”
