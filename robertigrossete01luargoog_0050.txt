xliv PREFAGE.

the whole question to the Bishop of Worcester and
the Archdeaeons of Worcester and Sudbury, who were
either to decide themselves on the whole question,
without allowing any appeal, or after the cause had
been sufficiently investigated, by a certain day 10 1)0
named by the Pope, to submit it 10 him 10 be finally
settled, each party in the meantime ceasing from
exercising any visitatorial power. The bishop seems to
have thought the business now 01 011 end3 he wrote
at once to the Pope, begging 1110 consent 130 1110 arrange-
ment, and in a letter to Otho at the same time ex-
presses his satisfaction that they have at length been
able to come 130 1011110.

Matthew Paris, wh0, as belonging 10 1110 rich monas-
tery of S. Alban's, is very jealous of episcopal inter-
ference, writes as a thorough partizan of the canons ;
and though not stating the whole arrangement quite
correctly‚ comments on this 10013 0101100 00 being unfair
to the canons, ‘⁶ For‚” he sayS, “ the bishop never did
“ visit, nor 0011 110 00000 who 1100 never begun‚ any more
“ than Diogenes can lose 1110 1101110 110 never had3
“ whereas the dean, by ceasing from his power 10
“ visit, if only for an hour, would be deprived of an
“ actual possession3 whence murmurs were multiplied
“ and 0 great scandal arose. The quarrel having
“ reached a very angry piteli, the canons did not
“ permit the bishop 10 enter the chapter or to mak'e
“ any visitation over them3 and they regretted ex·-
“ tremely that they had put over themselves such a
“ bishop of 00 humble an origin, and this they pub-
“ lickly expressed in the bishop's presence. After 0
“ great disturbance and heavy expenses spent to no
“ purpose on both sideS, an appeal was made to the
“ Pope, the chapter appointing Odo de Kilkenny as
‘⁶ their proctor.'' It would appear from this that
the arbitration‚ thus decided upon, proved a failure‚
