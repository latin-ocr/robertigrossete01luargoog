LXXIII. To rm: DEAN Am) CHAPTER or Lmeom - p. 235.

Progress of the quari-el with the dean and chapter. The
chapter have stated that the bishop has no power to decide
causes 01· correct offences of canons or persons connected
with the cathedral, except by appeal or neglect of the dean.
Examples of the results, if this opinion be acted upon, and
contrary arguments from Scripture. He thinks the chapter
cannot have perceived these consequence& but if they have,
and still desire to carry out their ideae, wishes to know on

what special law they rest.

LXXIV. To 'rim CARDINAL LEGATE 01·Ηο · p. 241.

Otho had requested a prebend at Lincoln, formerly
held by H„ for his clerk Atto. Grosseteste told P„ Otho²s

clerk, through whom the request was made, that he would
give his answer to Otho on his arrival in England, after
due consideration. He mentions now three points against

granting the request: (1) the sear of favouritism 3 (2) ho
is unwilling to give Atto a prebend with cure of souls
without a dispensation‚ as he has a cure already, and he
himself, who once held a prebend of this description and a
parish together, resigned the latter after consulting the
popc; (3) he thinks Atto is not best suited to Lincoln.
However, he finally leaves the case to Otho’s judgment.

Written while Otho was in England, therefore between
June 1237 and December 1240.

LXXVI. Το THE CAnnmAL LEGATE OTHO - - p. 245.

His clerks R. de Raveningham and J. de Orakhall, on
their return, have told him of Otho’s regard for him. Is
sorry that Otho is angry, because, acting on the authority
of the abbat of Pershore, delegated by the Pope‚ he has
directed the archdeacon of Lincoln to absolve a clerk
excommunicated by Otho. Hc had thought that in con-
versation Otho had approved of this beforehand.
