words ¹. That tho question was made the subject of
the canons' sermons in the cathedral, we learn from a
story told by Paris, While complaining of the bishop's
oppressione, one of them added, If we were to be silent,
the stone& would cry out ; on which a large portion of
the ehuroh fell down ².

Throughout the quarrel one is inclined to side with
Grosseteste, if only from the tone 111 which he writes,
He is always anxious for peace-{r peace upon right
principleS‚ ancl therefore more likely to be lasting‚—and
110 continually offers to alter any part of his conduct
that could be proved wrong. We ean have little sym-
pathy with a body of men who could reproaoh the
bishop With his humble origin. It would be tedious
to go through the whole affair, especially as only one
side of the question is before 118, and tha-t but very
partially to be gathered from the bishop's letters, It
seems to have been referred to other arbitrators at a,
later period, of whom the Bishop of Ely, Hugh de
Northw01d‚ and his official, Richard de Kirkham, were
the chief. The chapter in the meantime had been
resorting to underhand means to induce the king to
interfere on their side, and endeavoured to get the
whole business transferred from an ecelesiastioal to a,
civil tribunal, in which case they would, as Grosseteste
tells them, have incurred excommunication. He speaks

¹ I am not sure as to what the
Annalist precisely refers, His
words are ε “ Tandem, mediantibus
“ amieis convenerunt, ut oom-
“ munes nuncios mitterent ad Pa-
“ pam . . . Sed infecto negotio
“ nuntii redierunt.” This looks
rather as if the Pope refused to

admit the proposed arbitratorS.
² The szstable Annals tell us

what part of the chureh this was
that fell. “Facta est ruina muri
“ Lineolniensis eeclesiae secus oho-
“ rum, post sedem decani 3⁹⁹ and add
that three men were buried under
the ruins, Asterwards the choir
“ celebravit ante majus altare offi-
“ oium diurnum et nocturnum, ‹lo-
“ 1100 circumquaque columnae et
‘⁴ arcus firmarentur.” P. 239.
