11116 king's prohibition was not {30 have force, but they
were all to be deeided before the 611611661101· of 13116
University. It 16 not unlikely that 11116 was obtained
sshrough Grossetesbe’s influenoe, who thus laid 11116
foundation of the jurisdiction of 11116 University. For
though, 66 Wood remarkS, this was only granted
during the king's pleasure, it yet was confirmed bo
the chaneellor and to 1116 61166666016 for ever. The
