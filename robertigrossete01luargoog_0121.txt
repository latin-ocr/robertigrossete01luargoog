LETTERS OF BISHOP GROSSETESTE. CXV*-

as the fifth commandment applies more strongly to spiritual
than to natural parents. A bishop, therefore, must visit
all in his diocese who are not exempted, as a shepherd does
his floek. Indeed, a pastor cannot do his duty without
visiting. From Ezekiel we see iu what the feeding a
flock consists3 there is a difference between visor and
visitato-r. The dean, who always resides in the cathedral‚
cannot be its visitor, nor, if he could, would that be any
reason for excluding the bishop. This is shown by various
examples. What the advantages of frequent visitation are
S. Bet-nard has shown. It appears then that the bishop’s
, power to visit is always reserved to him, except in special
cases of exemption from the Pope, because, however an
inferior may limit this power, he cannot do away with it.
This is shown by reference 130 various scriptura] exampleS,
——Jacob feeding Laban’s sheep3 J acob’s sons3 the elder
son in the parable of the prodigal son, 8130. Again, 66616-
siastical discipline as well as exhortationis often necessary,
as appears from the 6686 of David keeping the lion and the
bear from his flock, for he would not have been hindered
in defending his flock by the shepherds under him 3 neither
6611 the bishops by their subject pastor-s. Besidcs, the
subject shepherds are inferior in power3 so the power of
the chapter in repressing vice is inferior to that of the
bishop. An argument is drawn from Samuel's circuib,
who was to the Israelites what the Pope is 111 the Church,
and each bishop in his own diocese. As the sun gives
light 130 13116 1110011 and stars‚ so the Pope imparts power 130
13116 bishops, and the bishops to their inferiors in each
diocese. They can no more hinder the bishOPS‚ than the
moon and 13116 stars the sun’s shining. Another argument
is drawn from Adam and 111176, Eve being a type of the
assistants to the bishopS. As a husband desii-es to have
his wife's person free from all stain, so does the bishop the
souls of all his diocese, and especially the cathedral chap-
ter. Again, to take an example from art and artificerS,
a worker in gold or brass ought to be able 130 know their
difference and to dctect impuritieS, and 80 13116 bishop in
the “ art of artS.’' The bishops are also watchmen‚ and
this involves discipline as well as exhortation, as appears
from various example& Watchmen are placed in vine-
yards to protect the vines ; and though the charge belongs

cipate him in the watch, and hc must see that they do their ’
duty. So also thc bishop. Aga-in, he is a spiritual physi-
