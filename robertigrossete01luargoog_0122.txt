cian, who must inspect the physicians under him. In all
arts 1110 master must know all the circumstances of the art
so as to correct errors, and how can this be denied in the
“ art of arts ?” The bishops are like parents and nurses
towards their children, and though the inferiors may be
themselves parents als0‚ yet they are sons, and therefore
subject to the bishop. Then in Paradise, though God gave
it in charge to angels‚ yet Himself punished Adam's sin.
Other instances from Scripture. What the (1111103 of
bishops in their dioceses are. Ezekiel’s vision used as an
example to them3 J eremiah a type of them as pillars of
the church. The commission given to inferiors no more
takes away the bishop’s power than Christ's to His apo-
31103 took away His. There are many ample proofs in
Scripture, which is the direct command of G-od. No civil
law or custom ought to interfere; indeed no custom can
be alleged, for custom is the habit of a lawfnl action, and
the absence of visitation is a positive evi13 nor is the
absence of visitation liberty. What liberty really is Philo
J udaeus has shown. The chapter cannot think themselves
too great to be visited, as appears from 0111· Lord’s own
submission, to say nothing of others; nor can they be free

‘from all need of a physician, when we find in Scripture

that none have sinned so grievously as priests3 and even
if they never go wrong, they may do s0, and therefore
require visitation to keep them right.

When the bishop comes to his church 1110 110113 ought to
be rung to give notice of his arrival to the people‚ even if
he returns within a short interval, as scarcely a day passos
without some one's needing absolution from the bishop.
⁴ Obedience 13 due to fleshly fathers, and so much more 10
spiritual 3 and the bishop is much more of afather towards
the dean and chapter than the dean is towards the chapter.
God listened to Joshua’s word, and stayed the sun. What
pride, then, must theirs be who refuse to listen to God’s
word, who has appointed the hig-her powers to be obeyed!

Written probably at the beginning of the quarrel with
the dean and chapter, and. therefore in 1239.
