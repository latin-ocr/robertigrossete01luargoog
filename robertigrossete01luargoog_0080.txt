lxxiv PREFACE.

September, still persevering in his endeavours3 but at
length finding it hopeless, returned homewardS, and
reached England, “ tristis et VaOUUS,” about Michaelmas
day. At first he appears to have been utterly broken
down and dispirited, and determined 011 resigning his
bishoprick ¹, and actually did as a preliminary‚ place the
administration of his official duties into the hands of his
friend and official, Robert de Marisco. The immediate

lies on him, and adds that it is not lawful to carry

resignation was after his return); nor, from what Paris
sayS, could it have been the king. It is more likely
that the other bishops or his friends had influence
enough to show him that his duty lay more 111
meeting his difficulties than in flying from them, and
