PREFACE. lxxxi

They advised the Pope to pass over the affair, lest
6 tumult should be excited‚ ancl this he seems to
have doneJ

A parliament was held in London in May, this
year, at which Grosseteste was present with the
other prelateS, When the question of the subsidy
to be granted. to the king was again brought forward.
After 6 long discussion he agreed to the ternis the
bishops had formerly offered him, and they then
solemnly exeonimunioatecl 611 violators of Magna
Charta. When the candles were thrown down,
extinguished and smoking, and each one said, “ So
“ may all who incur this sentence be extinguished
“ and stink in hell,'' and the 106113 were rung, the
king said: “ So help 1116 God, Ι will faithfully keep
‘³ 611 these things unimpaired‚ 63 Ι am 6 man, 63 Ι
“ 6111 6 Christian, as I 6111 6 knight, as I 6111 a crowned
“ and. anointed king? It shows how little saith was
placed in his promises, that Grosseteste‚ not eontented
with this publiok and general excommunication, had
the sentence read afterwards in every parish ohuroh

¹ A common theory 13 that the
Pope excommunicated him, and that
he appealed to the “ hy juge of
‘⁴ IIevene‚'·' to use Capgrave's words
(p.156). ButI can find no authority
sor it. Knyghton (if he 6611 be eonsi-
‹lered an authority) is the one quoted
for his excommunication‚ 601. 243 6.
Bardney’s romanoe makes the Pope
demand a subsidy from England3
Grosseteste refuses this, and 13 cited
to Rome, whither he goes, and is
111616 excommunicated. He appeals
to the ‘⁶ caelos ct summi J udicis ar-
“ ce111‚” and returns to England.
Tanner states that the Pope even
named 6 successor to his bishoprick,
one Albert‚ one of his 1111116103.

Βίὂῑὶοίή. Ρ. 19.v. Albert. I believe
this statement to have arisen entirely
through a mistake of bishop Tan-
ner’s. In the Lanercost Chronicle
(p. 58) ment-ion is made of Robert,
bishop of St. Andrew’S, whose
election was quashed by the Pope‚
and another person (one Abel)
nominated in his place. The
chronicler calls him Robertus, and
the next paragraph refers to Grosse-
teste. Tanner's eye seems to have
been caught by the Robertus above,
and thus he has jumbled the two
together, changing Abel into Albert.
He gives no authority for his state-
ment. Pegge (p. 198) follows
without examination.
