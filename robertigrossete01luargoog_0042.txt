Canterbury, who lectured from 1219 to 1226 ; but he
gives no authority for his statement. In 1224, at the Hist5 et
request of Agnellus‚ the provincial minister of the 3330&
Eranciscans in England, he became their first rector {1- P· 71 =
at Oxford, and, according to the Lanercost Chroniele‚ 1.p.195.
continued in this office till his election to the bishopriek
of Lincoln. Eccleston‚ to whom we owe the account Eccleston‚
of the first establishment of the Franciscans in England, P· 37.
speaks in very remarkable terms of his influence over
them ; under him, he says, “ inaestimabiliter infra breve
“ tempus, tam in concionibus quam praedicationi con-
“ gruis subtilibus moralitatibus, profecerunt.” Probably
his commentaries 011 Aristotle were written at this time,
and the foundation of his skill in preaching (see Wood,
i. p. 59 =i. p. 179) laid. What his earliest ecclesiastical
preferment was, it is difficult to say with certainty.
Pegge gives him the archdeaconry of Chester in 1210, See What.
but the authority does not seem satisfactory for this, {051171-12·
Bardney says 116 held the prebend of Clifton in Ibid· ii· p.
Lincoln cathedral. He was certainly Arehdeacon of 333‘
Wilts in the years 1214 and 1220, as appears from
the Salisbury registers, and may have exchanged this
office for the archdeaconry of N orthampton in 1221,
which he held With the prebend of Empingham, which
belonged to it. This again was exchanged for the arch-
deaconry of Leicester‚ which he probably held till 1231,
when he resigned all his preferments excepting his
prebend.

In May 1225 116 was collated by Hugh de Wells,
Bishop of Lincoln‚ to the church of Albodesley (Ab-
botsley‚ 111 Huntingdonshioe), which had been vacant

since November 12241.1 While Archdeaeon of Leicester
