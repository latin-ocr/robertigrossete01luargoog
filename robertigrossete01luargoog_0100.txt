arrangement, and the facts not being narrated in
chronological order under each year.

Lastly, it is perhaps needless now to point out the
very great assistance that such a collection of letters as
the present, especially when a chronological arrange-
ment can be attained, affor-ds towards enabling us to
understand the history of the times, and the thoughts
and motives of the 3011018. Ι think, however, that no
apology will be thought necessary for quoting the
following remarks of 0110 who is, perhaps, the most
qualified to speak upon this subject of any one now

living— Dr. Maitland.

“ Ι am 80 fully convinced ⁴of the value and impor-
“ tance of the immense number. of middle-age letters
“ which are still in 0111811οῃ00,- and of their not having
‘⁶ been yet made to yield any-thing like all the very
“ interesting materials which they contain for history,
“ that it has appeared to. me most desirable to obtain
‘⁶ something like a chronological arrangement of them.
“ The full value of such 3 thing cannot be estimated
“ until it is done ;.' but even a slight acquaintance
“ with comparatively few of them is sufficient to
“ persuade me that, when brought together by the
‘⁶ chronology which we have, one of the first effects
‘⁶ would be 3 correction of that chronology in almost
“ innumerable instances . . . Letters having no common
“.. ties as to their writerS, their locality, or their pro-
“ fessed subjects, and now suffered to lie in 3 wide
“ dispersim, would, if collected and arranged in order
“ of time, be found 130 dovetail in an infinite variety
“ of circumstanceS, and thus throw light on facts and
“ motiveS, fix dateS, identify personS, explain con-
“ tradictions,-—in a word, iHustrate history in every
“ way, and that, perhaPS, to a greater degree than we
‘⁶ can at present imagine, or could by any other
“ means perform.” ¹
