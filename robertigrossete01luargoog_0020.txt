osin ino in Grosseteste has been styled one of the harbingers
311101ξέ of the Refomaffion. If this means that by his deter-
mined endeavours to rai se the character of the clergy,
the zeal with which he strove against 61011666, 1116
unceasing opposition to all impl-oper presentationS,-—-
from however high a source they originated,--—his
sense of the awful responsibility of his office, his
anxiety for the study at Oxford of the Scriptures
above all other 110οΚ6, and his efforts to prevent
the clergy from usurping functions that would lead
them away from their clerical dutieS, 116 led the
way towards that event, it is certainly true. But
if it implies that he had any tendency towards the
doctrina] changes then brought about in the Ohurch,
or that he evidenced any idea of a separation of the
Ohurch of England from that of Rome, a more
utterly mistaken statement has never been made. He
was essentially a man of his own time, feeling
vividly what were the great causes which were
disturbing the Church and lowering the character
both of clergy and people, and he eagerly seized and
directed the means which the age offered towards
the removal of these 6611666, and, the improvement of
the condition of the country. If judged from this
standard and with this in view, there is scarcely a
character in English history that stands higher. But
to judge him by the ideas prevalent in the sixteenth
century, or to expect to find him influenced by similar
motives to those which were influencing men's minds
then, is to dc him great injustice3 aud such a view

of his character can only arise from ignorance of the
actual facts.
