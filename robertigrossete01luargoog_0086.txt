ascertained how enormous was the rapacity of the
Roman eourt3 he had seen how entirely gold would
accomplish anything there3 the Pope had deceived
and insulted him in their last intervieW3 and he
felt a stand must be made against his exactions. His
course in this ease seemed clear. The Pope, when the Matt. Par„
letter reached him, was almost beside himself with rage. P· 3⁷2·
“ Who,’' 116 exclaimed, “is this old madma-n, deas

‘⁶ wonder to the whole world. Is not the king of
“ England our vassal, not to say slave, since we can, at

“ theology in the 36110013, a preacher to the people,
“ a lover of chastity‚ and a persecutor of Simonists.’'
