to be loved rather than feared by . those about them3
and that ecclesiasticks are to be rather fathers of the
poor than princes of the people. Possibly there may
have been a harshness in Grosseteste’s manner or mode
of proceeding, though certainly no sign of this is
visible in the letters he wrote to them. Indeed, the
very curious and lengthy argumentative letter (or rather
pamphlet) which he addressed to them on the subject
is a very remarkable evidence to the contrary, its tone
being most moderate throughout. It is a very singular
specimen of the mode of thought of the time. And if
1116 arguments seem weak and fanciful to us now, it
should be remembered that not only are they such as
appeared weighty to Grosseteste, but also such as he
expected would influence the chapter, and thus give a
curious insight into the mediaeval mind. The thorough
familiarity with the Old Testament is, perhaps, only
what we might expect3 but the use which 16 made of
the actions of all the characters of Scripture, and the
forced and sometimes outrageous way in which they
are introduced to illustrate his argument, show how
thoroughly “biblical” the age waS, and how completely
the Old Testament history was regarded rather 66 1116
guide of men’s conduct in Christian 1111166, than as a
mere historica] record of past events, I have given an
analysis of it in the table of contents3 but one speci-
men may be mentioned here. Grosseteste is endeavour-
ing to prove that the bishop, in delegating a portion
of his authority to the chapter, does not resign it
altogether, and, 66 611 11111611611011, 11161611666 1116 con-

to the angele the care over man3 but when he sinned,
God Himself interfered and punished, not leaving it ·
to the angele to do it.
