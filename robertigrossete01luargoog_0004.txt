Τ116 works to be published in octavo, separately, as
they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the task
resting upon the editorS‚ who were to be chosen by the
Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasury. ,

Τ116 Lords of Her Majesty's Treasury‚ astera careful
conside-ration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Treasury Minute‚ dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of the· Rolls “ was well
calculated for the accomplishment of this important
national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention bc
paid to economy, in making the detailed arrangementS,
without unnecessary expense.”

They expresscd their approbation of the proposal that
each chronicle and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible correct-
ness the text of each writer, derived from a collation of the
best M SS„ and that no notes should be added, except
such as were illustrative of the various readings. They
suggested, however, that the preface to each work should
contain, in addition to the particulars proposed by the
Master of the Rolls, a biographical account of the author,
so far as authentic materials existed :for that purpose, and
an estimate of his historic-al credibility and value.
