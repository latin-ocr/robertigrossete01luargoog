employed himself in translating the “ Testaments of

fact of its being mentioned by almost every chronicler.
Of Grosseteste’s part in the translation I have already
spoken. We may probably put down to this year⁴
the singular letter to his chapter (Ne. xcv„ p. 296),

object. Adam de Mariseo's language‚ Letter xiii„ p. 96
(probably written at this time from the mention of the
bishop of Worcester as shortly about to visit Grosse-

Grosseteste in answer to the Bishop of Worcester's
letter, asking for advice as to whether he should follow
