ing a heavy complaint against the bishop. Grosse-
teste having brought together the 111611οΡ of Gonnor,
and the abbats of Ramsey and Peterborough, at Hert-
ford‚ at once proceeded to depose the abbat, as con-
victed and rebellious, and signified to the convent that
they were no longer held to obey him in anything,
but were to look upon him as deposed as well as ex-
