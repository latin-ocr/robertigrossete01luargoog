LVI. To WILLIAM EARL or WARREN - - p. 171.

Τ116 earl has written that he is astonished at the citation
of himself and his chaplain to appear before Grosseteste,
and the suspension of the latter. But he has caused
his chaplain to celebrate mass in his hall at Grantham, an
unconsecrated place, and otherwise unfit, on the ground of
his health. The chaplain has been suspended for repeated
contumacy 3 and to summon the earl was to give him an
opportunity of olearing himself.
