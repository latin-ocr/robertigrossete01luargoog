PREFAOE. lxiii

There is another charge against Grosseteste connected
with this affair. He entirely sequestrated and alienated
the church of Aylesbury, Which had always belonged
to the deanery of Lincoln, and at once gave it to his
official Robert de Marisc0, one of the canonS, (afterwards
deam) his reason being, according to Matthew PariS,
that he believed that the dean “ ex ejus ubertate
“ cornua audaciae assumentem, contra episcopum Lin-
“ colniensem recalcitrare.''

However, by whatever means obtained, the bishop’s
triumph was complete as far as the question of visi-
tation was concerned. The bull of Innocent, dated
August 25, goes through all the points very
elaborately, and in almost all, excepting that the Pope
decided that an oath from the dean and canons 011
their collation was not to be exacted, though they
were to exhibit obedience and reverence, the points
at issue were decided in favour of the bishop. He
seems to have been well satisfied with the decision,
as appears from his mentioning in a letter to the
provincial minister of the Franciscans in England,
that it had been given in his favour, and therefore also
in that of all the bishops of England.

Epist. <mv- ’ The bishop has given an accurate account of his
journey home from the council. In company with
Adam de Marisco and John of Stamford, 110 reached
Beaune, and there the latter fell ill of a quartan ague.
They brought him to N ogent on the Seine, and thence
by water to Paris. As 110 was too ill to go 011 with
them homewards, and Paris was at that time in an
unhealthy state, Adam determined to go on to Rouen
with him by water. At ManteS, however, 110 was too
ill to go further, and Grosseteste then wrote for Peter
of Tewkesbury to be sent over with some other friars
to take care of him, and to relieve Adam de Mar-ism,

· whom he was afraid to leave behind for any time,

lest he should stay permanently‚ as many were2anxious
