CONTENTS OF THE

of Rome is so great, that if the Pope and cardinale were to
order him to go to preach the gospel to the SaracenS,
though weak and infirm in body, he would at once go,
He knows that they have the power of freely ordering
concerning ecelesiastica] benefices, but interference with
the rights of patrous ean only cause seandal. Otho ought
not therefore to have thus confused him by conferring this
prebend on his own authority, especially as he is ready to
provide liberally for any of Otho's friends ; although, since
his consecration, a nephew of the Pope’s was promoted to
0110 of the best of the Lincoln prebende. Hopes that Otho
will recall his collation.

Probably written in 1238. Atto is mentioned by Matt.
Par. p. 448.

L. To Ronnnr nn HAYLES, AROHDEACON or- meoLN p. 146.

Ηο intends to preach to his clergy in their deaneries.
The archdeacon is therefore directed to desire the rural
deans to call the clergy together at the times and places
he shall appoint. All churches to be consecrated must be
got ready, 33 the Council of London 1133 required all not
yet consecrated to be consecrated within two years. Asks
for advice respecting procurations and clerks guilty of
incontinence.

Written probably early in 1238, 33 1110 Council of London
was held in November 1237. Sec Matt. Par. p. 449.

LI. To THoMAS WALLENSIS - — - p. 147.

As Robert de Hayles is dead, he offers the archdeaconry
of Lincoln with 'a prebend to Thomas W„ on the under-
standing 110 13 to reside upon it. Believes him to be the
fittest person for the post. Exhorts him not to hesitate
to leave his chair at Paris, 33 11113 13 3 higher office, nor to

fear any accusation of greediness or ambition.
Written in 1238.

LII. To CARDINAL Orno - - - ·· p. 151.

Otho has requested him to admit to 1110 benefice of Rand‚
Thomas, 3011 of earl FerrerS, though too young and not in
holy orders, His scruples about this· Begs Otho to
persuade the earl to present some other fit person3 other-
wise, refers the matter for this time 10 Otho himself. If
Thomas does have the living, hopes that a vicar may be
appointed, or a proper pastor, some provision being made
for ThomaS, without any cure of souls‚ out of the benefice.

Written probably about the same time.
