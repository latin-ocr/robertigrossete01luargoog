that knew Thomas *Aquinas and Albertus Magnus ¹,—
it may be well to produce some few contemporary
Roger opinione. Let ue first take Roger Bacon‚ himself
Baeon. probably second in universality to none. He says of
him, “ Solus unus scivit scientiae, ut Lincolniensis epis-
“ copus '² (Opus Tertium, ed. Brewer‚ p. 33) 3 or again,
“ Solus dominus Robertus, propter longitudinem vitw
“ et vias mirabiles quibus usus est, prae aliis homi-
“ nibus scivit scientias '’ (Ooonpcndizmn studii, p. 472).
Tyssyng- Or to take a very different writer, Tyssyngton (in
‘⁰¹¹’ Shirley’s Fasciculi Zizcmior‘ztm, p. 135) speaks of,
‘⁶ Lincolniensis, cujus comparatio ad omnes doctores
“ modernos est velut comparatio solis ad lunam
“ quando eclipsatur.'' And indeed, though his life, as
Bacon remarke, was a long one, yet the number and
variety of the works attributed to him make it
difficult to conceive how a man of such active habits
and in such constant occupatiori could have found
time to master, far inore to write, so much. Doubtless
many books and tracte have been fathered upon him,
as is so continually the case with voluminous writers
of the middle ages, Thus, the tract De Digynitoetc
Conditionie humcmoe‚. which he himself quotes (p. 10)
as if from S. Augustine, is included in some lists of his
workS. So also are the Ocu-lus M arceiis of Archbishop
Peccham, and the Sti-mulus C‘onscientiOE, which was
written in the middle of the following century‚' by
Richard Rolle of Hampole (a writer who in his turn
has had a large proportion of the literature of his
time attributed to him) 3 while, on the other hand, the
Parvus Cato (or Pety Caton, as Fabyan‚ p. 336, calls
it‚) ie found in some MSS. of the twelfth century.
