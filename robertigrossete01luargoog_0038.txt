XXX PREFAOE.

to have been rather indifferent about 13110, matter.
However, whether he was convinced or not, the
prelate8‚ who brought for-ward this question at the
Parliament of Merton in 1236, could not, as is well
known, persuade the Barons to alter the law.
The Jews. The condition of the Jews we find on more than
one occasion occupying Grosseteste's attention. Their
, usurious oppressions seem to have reached a frightful
extent3 and we find the University of Oxford
obtaining a royal privilege to limit their exactions
in cases of loans 130 13110 students (see below, p. lxix.)
His opinions on the whole question of their condition
may' be seen by his letter to 13110 Countess of
Winehester. See below under the year 1231 (p. xxxv.)
'Ijhe liber· The attacks on the liberties of the Church form the
ὁῗηξξξιθ subject of a lengthy letter 01· rather pamphlet (Epist.
lxxii.*), to be found in the present volume. Grosseteste's
great grievance, and one to which he frequently 1001110,
was the appointment and acceptance of the office of
justice itinerant by abbats or by other ecclesiastica]
persons. He apparently felt this more strongly than
the other bishops of his time, as we find him com-
plaining that he could not get the archbishop to
move in the matter. He writes on one occasion to
the archbishop 011 131110 point, evidently determined not
to give way, though he knows the offence he will
give the king, and the risk he personally runs. The
compelling clerks to submit to the lay tribunale„ when
it 10 doubtful whether the cause be ecclesiastica] or
lay, and this doubt is settled by the lay courtS, is
another grievance of which he complains heavily.
Uzzah and Uzziah furnish warnings to the king, of
which he makes continual use. The difficulty of
getting Magna Charta carried out, in spite of promises
on the royal side and threatened excommunication on
that of the bishOPS‚ is but too evident from many
passages in these letters.
