the consecration of Richard of Wendover, Bishop of
Rochester, at St. Gregory'S, Canterbury.

This strenuous visitation stirred up opposition3 and ‘³⁰

in the following year the serious misunderstanding
with his chapter, which became a quarrel which lasted
for six yearS‚ and was at length only quieted by the
decision of the Pope himself, took its -rise. The
bishop felt it to be very unsatisfactory, that while so
much in the diocese wanted a thorough reform, and
therefore he required the aid of all the clergy of his
diocese, there should exist an inlperinm in imperio, a
body of men joined by common interestS, who declined

the country, each diocese feeling that these proceedings
would settle the whole question for itself also3 and
110 little seandal was excited by its long continuance.
Thus we find the Dean and Chapter of Salisbury
(Grosseteste had been, be it remembered, Archdeacon
of wilte), expressing this to the bishop himself, and
A. de beseeching him to make peace. Adam de MariscO, 3130,
