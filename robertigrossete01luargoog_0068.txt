lxii PREFACE.
took place3 and the next mouth (February 19), Roger
de Weseham, the dean ‘of Lincoln, was consecrated
bishop of Lichfield3 while soon after the cause
between Grosseteste and 1118 chapter was determined
wholly 011 the side of the bishop. However satisfac-
tory this decision of an affair that had gone 011 for so
long and given so much annoyanee to all parties, and
however much one might wish to think differ-
ently, 113 18 difficult not to suspect unfair dealings
between the bishop and the dean. In the first place the
dean, Roger de Weseham, is Grosseteste's intimate friend,
-he 18 sent by the chapter to represent them and
plead their cause,--he has not been at Lyons more
than a few weekS‚ when by Grosseteste’s influenee
(without. the king's consent, who had refused his
consent to Wffliam de Monte Pessulano‚ the choice
of the monks), he is elected bish op of Liehfield‚
and immediately afterwards Grosseteste gains from the
Pope a bull giving him all he asks for against the
chapter. It is difficult not to suspect that a bargain
was struck between these two. If Weseham really felt
that the claims of the chapter were altogether wrong,
why did he go out as their representative? ¹

The letter of Adam de Marisco,
to which allusion has been already
made, written immediately 011 their
arrival at Lyons, mentions that the
Pope had promised that the affair
should soon be settled. He adds:
“ Mortalibus tamen dubius est
“ eventus belli,'’ and speaks of the
delays, eaviIS, stratagemS, &a of
the opposite party. Possibly Grosse-
teste, wearied out with the long
delay, was tempted to win over the
dean in the way it appears he did.
